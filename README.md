App Brewery project to learn and practice Bootstrap, CSS, Javascript, backend database development.

# Purpose of the AMA project

Here's the AMA project in a nutshell -- If anyone has used Google to search for answers to questions, for example "What is the definition of genealogy?" you'll see Google uses the Bootstrap accordion to provide several questions/answers. Clicking on a question opens the answer and also produces additional 'Q/A cards', adding them to the bottom of the accordion.

Now, Google has access to the entire web to create the Q/A cards. But we could create a back-end database to store Q/A cards and add them to a front-end accordion that we develop.

Initially our 'AMA' accordion could answer questions about a single subject, say CSS attributes or Javascript functions. The database would store the Q/A card records and the initial accordion would list just three or four questions. Each time a user clicks on a question the accordion would display the answer and add two-three more Q/A cards.

The added Q/A cards would be random, but just be adding Q/A cards with information about a specific subject (e.g. CSS attributes). Once we get the initial front-end and back-end working we could add another feature to the webpage allowing visitors to choose a category of information (e.g. CSS attributes or Javascript functions). Or allow the accordion to randomly add Q/A cards from all chosen categories.

The goal of the project is to supply random facts or information about a particular subject. Websites like Mozilla and W3 Schools provide tutorials that lead someone down an ordered path. Or a visitor could search for a certain subject (e.g. CSS positioning). But the AMA website would add randomization to the learning process. Sometimes that's more valuable.

If you've ever used a printed encyclopedia you would be familiar with 'jumping from one subject to another' -- you may be reading about a particular subject that mentions some other subject of interest; you find yourself jumping from one subject to another. It's an unordered way of learning and produces different results from following a step-by-step tutorial. That's what I'd like the AMA website to enable.

The other goal of the AMA project would be to provide training as web developers. It would also teach us about project management and using GitHub.
